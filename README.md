MicroBot-

The MicroBot is a Tabletop Voice Assistant Robot which is compact, low-cost and user-friendly conversational
agent designed to sit on a desk and provide hands-free assistance. It listens to voice queries
through an omnidirectional microphone, leverages cloud-based large language models (LLMs)
such as OpenAI ChatGPT or Google Gemini for intelligent responses, and replies audibly while
simultaneously displaying text and facial expressions on a 0.96-inch OLED display. A micro servo
enables the robot's head to track the user within a 90-degree arc, enhancing both interactivity
and personality through animated eye expressions indicating emotional states such as
happiness, sadness, anger and excitement.
